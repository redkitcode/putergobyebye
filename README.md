# putergobyebye.exe
a simple virus type thing i made with chatgpt, krita notepad and youtube.
idk what else to say

# installation
just go to https://github.com/redkitcode/putergobyebye/blob/main/putergobyebye.exe and click download raw file. if your browser says anything about a dangerous virus, turn off your antivirus.

# requirements (no way around them muahahaha)
have a vm prepped, and learn how to use one. if you dont want to download one..
TOO BAD!
or of course, you can go to https://app.apponfly.com/trial i guess, either way works.
